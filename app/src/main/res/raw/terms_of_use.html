      <p lang="en-US"><strong>PREAMBLE</strong></p>
      <p lang="en-US">E Foundation develops mobile operating systems, applications and tools designed to protect users' privacy.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">As part of this effort, /e/OS is a non-profit operating system project, supported by an international team of experienced entrepreneurs, developers and designers, and a growing community of collaborators.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">But beyond the operating system, applications are also essential elements of a good smartphone experience.</p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            <h1 lang="en-US">PURPOSE</h1>
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p lang="en-US">In this context, "App Lounge" is an application that provides access to a set of applications that can then be downloaded and installed on your cell phone (hereafter, "the Software").</p>
      <p lang="en-US">E Foundation is the publisher of App Lounge.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">The "users" are the persons who use the Software and are addressed as "you".</p>
      <p lang="en-US">The Software is accessible on the cell phone of users who can use it.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">Pursuant to Articles 7(4) and 20 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, the Software allows you to exercise your rights to the protection of your personal data.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">Firstly, the Software allows you to exercise your right to download applications without this action being coupled with the collection and processing of your personal data.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">Secondly, in case you're using the "Anonymous" mode or the "Signed in with Google" mode the Software allows you to exercise your right to data portability, under your direction and responsibility to download applications from the Google Play Store.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">In this context, you will be able to download the applications of your choice, either anonymously or through your Google account.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">In both cases, you will have a direct relationship with the Google Play Store, with App Lounge running directly from your cell phone, and E Foundation will not collect any data in any capacity.</p>
      <p lang="en-US"> In case you're solely using the "PWA and Open Source apps" mode you are not concerned by this second point regarding your personal data and Google.
      <ol start="2">
         <li>
            <h1 lang="en-US">VALIDITY AND ACCEPTANCE</h1>
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p><span lang="en-US">The purpose of these Terms of Use is to define the terms and conditions under which Users may access and use the Software. They constitute a contract between E Foundation and the Users. They supersede all previous provisions and, except for specific conditions, constitute the entirety of the rights and obligations of the parties.</span></p>
      <p lang="en-US">By installing App Lounge and using the Software, Users agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions and to accept them without reservation.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">If you refuse to comply with any of the obligations and conditions contained in the Agreement, you must forfeit access to and use of the Software.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">You represent and warrant that you have the legal capacity to contract and, if you are a legal entity, that you are authorized to act on behalf of such entity.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">You declare that you have the right to use the Software.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">Furthermore, when using the "Anonymous" mode or the "Signed in with Google" mode you declare that you have read the Terms and Conditions of the Google Play Store as indicated at: https://play.google.com/</p>
      <p lang="en-US">You also declare to respect them, when exercising your right to benefit from a service that is not coupled with the collection and processing of your personal data, as well as when exercising your right to the portability of your data.</p>
      <p lang="en-US"> When solely using the "PWA and Open Source apps" mode you are not compelled to read and respect the Terms and Conditions of the Google Play Store.
      <p lang="en-US">These General Conditions are concluded for the duration of the use of the Software by the User.</p>
